I started studying code as a software developer, it quickly felt boring to me since all I ended up doing were softwares that were useful and actually functional, but didn´t feel like a "creation" to me. That´s when I discovered ✨GAME ENGINES✨ and decided to give Unity a try. It amazed me how fascinating it was to write a bit of code and then, all of a sudden, I had created something alive(ish?)!. I decided to keep on studying and made a Master´s Degree on Videogame Programming, suffered Unreal Engine´s wrath and, after long months of learning and practicing, ended up loving it!. Right now I´m working hard to improve myself, learn new technologies and achieve new goals.
